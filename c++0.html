<h2 style="text-align:center;font-size:30px">C++ Introduction</h2>
<h2>What is C++?</h2><hr></hr>
<p>
1.C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications.<br><br>

2.C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension to the C language.<br><br>

3.C++ gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory.<br><br>

The language was updated 3 major times in 2011, 2014, and 2017 to C++11, C++14, and C++17.<br><br>
</p>
<h2>Why Use C++</h2><hr></hr>
<p>
1.C++ is one of the world's most popular programming languages.<br><br>

2.C++ can be found in today's operating systems, Graphical User Interfaces, and embedded systems.<br><br>

3.C++ is an object-oriented programming language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs.
<br><br>
4.C++ is portable and can be used to develop applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms.
<br><br>
5.C++ is fun and easy to learn!
<br><br>
As C++ is close to C# and Java, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to C++ or vice versa
<br><br>
</p>
<h2>C++ Syntax</h2><hr></hr>
<p>
Let's break up the following code to understand it better:
<br></br>
Example <br></br>
#include <iostream><br></br>
using namespace std;<br></br>

int main() {<br></br>
  cout << "Hello World!";<br></br>
  return 0;<br></br>
}<br></br>

Example explained<br></br>
Line 1: #include <iostream> is a header file library that lets us work with input and output objects, such as cout (used in line 5). Header files add functionality to C++ programs.
<br></br>
Line 2: using namespace std means that we can use names for objects and variables from the standard library.
<br></br>
Line 3: A blank line. C++ ignores white space. But we use it to make the code more readable.
<br></br>

Line 4: Another thing that always appear in a C++ program, is int main(). This is called a function. Any code inside its curly brackets {} will be executed.
<br></br>

Line 5: cout (pronounced "see-out") is an object used together with the insertion operator (<<) to output/print text. In our example it will output "Hello World".
<br></br>

Note: Every C++ statement ends with a semicolon ;.
<br></br>

Note: The body of int main() could also been written as:
<br></br>
int main () { cout << "Hello World! "; return 0; }
<br></br>

Remember: The compiler ignores white spaces. However, multiple lines makes the code more readable.
<br></br>

Line 6: return 0 ends the main function.
<br></br>

Line 7: Do not forget to add the closing curly bracket } to actually end the main function.
<br></br>
