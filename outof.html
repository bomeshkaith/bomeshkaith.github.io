Therefore, in simple terms, programming is a task to implement a solution to a problem in the form of computer language. In this section, we will discuss the
 word programming, programming languages, its type, advantages, disadvantages, and their uses.

<p> C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications.
 <br></br>
C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension to the C language.
</br></br>
C++ gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory.
<br></br>
C++ can be found in today's operating systems, Graphical User Interfaces, and embedded systems.
<br></br>
C++ is an object-oriented programming language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs.
<br></br>
C++ is portable and can be used to develop applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms.
<br></br>
C++ is fun and easy to learn!
<br></br>
As C++ is close to C# and Java, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to C++ or vice versa.
