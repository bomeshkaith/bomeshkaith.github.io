<h1>
Java Class Methods</h1>
<p>
You learned from the Java Methods chapter that methods are declared within a class, and that they are used to perform certain actions:
</p>
<h3>
Example</h3>
Create a method named myMethod() in Main:<br>
public class Main {<br>
  static void myMethod() {<br>
    System.out.println("Hello World!");<br>
  }<br>
}<h3>
 
myMethod() prints a text (the action), when it is called. To call a method, write the method's name followed by two parentheses () and a semicolon;
<br>
Example</h3>
Inside main, call myMethod():<br>
public class Main {<br>
  static void myMethod() {<br>
    System.out.println("Hello World!");<br>
  }<br>
  public static void main(String[] args) {<br>
    myMethod();<br>
  }<br>
}<br>

// Outputs "Hello World!"<br>
 <h1>
Static vs. Non-Static</h1>
<p>You will often see Java programs that have either static or public attributes and methods.
<br>
In the example above, we created a static method, which means that it can be accessed without creating an object of the class, unlike public, which can only be accessed by objects:
</p>
<h3>
Example</h3>
<p>
An example to demonstrate the differences between static and public methods:
</p>
public class Main {<br>
  // Static method<br>
  static void myStaticMethod() {<br>
    System.out.println("Static methods can be called without creating objects");<br>
  }<br>
  // Public method<br>
  public void myPublic Method() {<br>
    System.out.println("Public methods must be called by creating objects");<br>
  }<br>

  // Main method<br>
  public static void main(String[] args) {<br>
    myStaticMethod(); // Call the static method<br>
    // myPublicMethod(); This would compile an error<br>

    Main myObj = new Main(); // Create an object of Main<br>
    myObj.myPublicMethod(); // Call the public method on the object<br>
  }<br>
}<br>
 
<h3>Note: You will learn more about these keywords (called modifiers) in the Java Modifiers chapter.
</h3>
<h1>
Access Methods With an Object
</h1>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>
Create a Car object named myCar. Call the fullThrottle() and speed() methods on the myCar object, and run the program:
</p>
// Create a Main class<br>
public class Main {<br>
  // Create a fullThrottle() method<br>
  public void fullThrottle() {<br>
    System.out.println("The car is going as fast as it can!");<br>
  }<br>

  // Create a speed() method and add a parameter<br>
  public void speed(int maxSpeed) {<br>
    System.out.println("Max speed is: " + maxSpeed);<br>
  }<br>

  // Inside main, call the methods on the myCar object<br>
  public static void main(String[] args) {<br>
    Main myCar = new Main();   // Create a myCar object<br>
    myCar.fullThrottle();      // Call the fullThrottle() method<br>
    myCar.speed(200);          // Call the speed() method<br>
  }<br>
}<br>

// The car is going as fast as it can!<br>
// Max speed is: 200<br>

<h3>Example explained</h3>
<p>1) We created a custom Main class with the class keyword.
<br>
2) We created the fullThrottle() and speed() methods in the Main class.
<br>
3) The fullThrottle() method and the speed() method will print out some text, when they are called.
<br>
4) The speed() method accepts an int parameter called maxSpeed - we will use this in 8).
<br>
5) In order to use the Main class and its methods, we need to create an object of the Main Class.
<br>
6) Then, go to the main() method, which you know by now is a built-in Java method that runs your program (any code inside main is executed).
<br>
7) By using the new keyword we created an object with the name myCar.
<br>
8) Then, we call the fullThrottle() and speed() methods on the myCar object, and run the program using the name of the object (myCar), followed by a dot (.), followed by the name of the method (fullThrottle(); and speed(200);). Notice that we add an int parameter of 200 inside the speed() method.
<br>
<p>Remember that..<br>
The dot (.) is used to access the object's attributes and methods.<br>

To call a method in Java, write the method name followed by a set of parentheses (), followed by a semicolon (;).
<br>
A class must have a matching filename (Main and Main.java).
<br>
<h1>
Using Multiple Classes
</h1>
<p>Like we specified in the Classes chapter, it is a good practice to create an object of a class and access it in another class.
<br>
Remember that the name of the java file should match the class name. In this example, we have created two files in the same directory:
<br>
<ul>
<li>
Main.java</li>
<li>
Second.java</li>
<li>
Main.java</li>
public class Main {<br>
  public void fullThrottle() {<br>
    System.out.println("The car is going as fast as it can!");<br>
  }<br>

  public void speed(int maxSpeed) {
<br>
 System.out.println("Max speed is: " + maxSpeed);<br>
  }<br>
}<br>
Second.java
class Second {<br>
  public static void main(String[] args) {<br>
    Main myCar = new Main();     // Create a myCar object<br>
    myCar.fullThrottle();      // Call the fullThrottle() method<br>
    myCar.speed(200);          // Call the speed() method<br>
  }<br>
}<br>
<h3>When both files have been compiled:
</h3>
<h3>
C:\Users\Your Name>j avac Main.java<br>
C:\Users\Your Name>javac Second.java<br>
Run the Second.java file:</h3>

C:\Users\Your Name>java Second
And the output will be:

The car is going as fast as it can!
Max speed is: 200
