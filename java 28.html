Java Inheritance (Subclass and Superclass)</h1>
<p>
In Java, it is possible to inherit attributes and methods from one class to another. We group the "inheritance concept" into two categories:
<br>
subclass (child) - the class that inherits from another class<br>
superclass (parent) - the class being inherited from<br>
To inherit from a class, use the extends keyword.<br>

In the example below, the Car class (subclass) inherits the attributes and methods from the Vehicle class (superclass):
</p>
<h3>
Example</h3>
class Vehicle {
  protected String brand = "Ford";        // Vehicle attribute<br>
  public void honk() {                    // Vehicle method<br>
    System.out.println("Tuut, tuut!");<br>
  }<br>
}<br>
class Car extends Vehicle {<br>
  private String modelName = "Mustang";    // Car attribute<br>
  public static void main(String[] args) {<br>

    // Create a myCar object<br>
    Car myCar = new Car();<br>

    // Call the honk() method (from the Vehicle class) on the myCar object<br>
    myCar.honk();<br>

    // Display the value of the brand attribute (from the Vehicle class) and the value of the modelName from the Car class<br>
    System.out.println(myCar.brand + " " + myCar.modelName);<br>
  }<br>
}<br>
 

<h3|>Did you notice the protected modifier in Vehicle?
</h3>
<p>
We set the brand attribute in Vehicle to a protected access modifier. If it was set to private, the Car class would not be able to access it.
<br></p>
<h3>
Why And When To Use "Inheritance"?
</h3>
<p>- It is useful for code reusability: reuse attributes and methods of an existing class when you create a new class.
</p><h3>
Tip: Also take a look at the next chapter, Polymorphism, which uses inherited methods to perform different tasks.
</h3>
<h1>
The final Keyword</h1>
<br>
<p>If you don't want other classes to inherit from a class, use the final keyword:
<br>
If you try to access a final class, Java will generate an error:
<br>
final class Vehicle {
  <br>...
}<br>

class Car extends Vehicle {<br>
  ...<br>
}<br>
The output will be something like this:
</p>
<p>
Main.java:9: error: cannot inherit from final Vehicle<br>
class Main extends Vehicle {<br>
                  ^
