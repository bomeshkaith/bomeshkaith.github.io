Java - What is OOP?

</h1>
<p>OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming.
<br>
Procedural programming is about writing procedures or methods that perform operations on the data, while object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and methods.
<br>
Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming:
<br>
OOP is faster and easier to execute<br>
OOP provides a clear structure for the programs<br>
OOP helps to keep the Java code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug<br>
OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time<br></p>
<h3>
Tip: The "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle is about reducing the repetition of code. You should extract out the codes that are common for the application, and place them at a single place and reuse them instead of repeating it.

Java - What are Classes and Objects?

</h1>
<p>Classes and objects are the two main aspects of object-oriented programming.
<br>
Look at the following illustration to see the difference between class and objects:
</p>
<pre>

Class                           Objects
Fruit    
                                 Apple

                                 Banana

                                 Mango
<h3>
Another example: </h3>              
Objects                   Audi
Volvo

                         Toyota

                         Objects
                         volvo

</pre>
<p>
So, a class is a template for objects, and an object is an instance of a class.<br>

When the individual objects are created, they inherit all the variables and methods from the class.</p>
